# Friday: The Thrilling Adventures of Craig and Smokey
Play the game here:

### Technologies Used
1. A Javascript 'classes' creation system for players and enemies similar to Object and Orcs<br>
2. A series of real-time JQuery manipulations to update player stats.<br>
3. Function based activities to simulate a turn based encapsulated battle structure.<br>
4. Functionality to determine damage dealt, turn cycle, win/lose status and reaction, and player input activity logging.<br>
5. JQuery and CSS to form a scrolling status window.<br>
6. CSS for popups, user interaction, and overall appeal.<br><br>

### Approach
I wanted to create a basic game for fans of the film Friday, which admittedly may only include a handful of people. It incorporates the two main heroes and a handful of other characters leading up to the main villain Deebo, who torments the duo throughout the day. It includes a single page design with images, titles, and status boxes positioned accordingly. The player boxes update upon code change and the main status box scrolls vertically. There is color change feedback to determine which action buttons can be interacted with, as well as for the current turn indicator. Finally, when a character makes a move, his picture shakes. <br><br>

### Comments
While I was able to make a fun game (I even found the correct title font from the film!), there's always room for expansion and modification. Some changes I would include in the future:<br>
1. Better styling for changing screen sizes, including mobile. It's visually appropriate on my monitors, but given more time, better CSS is always appreciated.
2. I would like to include random happenings with the ability to power up the character or receive status bonuses from NPC's. 
3. The difficulty level is fairly straight forward and could benefit from customization. The player likely doesn't want to repeat play multiple times without a skill level increase. That could be introduced with stat changes, additional bosses, sub-enemies, etc.<br><br>

Ultimately, I hope my love of this film shows through the gaudy background color as nothing but a tribute to a mighty fine movie!
